Summary of character : Piccolo jr but we call him piccolo now arrived during the later parts of the original dragon ball story line during the end of the king piccolo arc and during his arc he becomes a menace to society not as much as his father but still a menace .He then later on the series recieves a redepmtion arc during the vegeta/saiyan saga were my man sacrificed himself to save gohan . He also almost always gets alot of L's for example the fight against goku , nappa 3rd form freeza , and semi perfect cell . Atleast he beat raditz during the saiyan saga :) 	</td>

He only used it in his fight against goku during the finale of og dragon ball and once in the movie dragon ball super : super hero but its still cool tho . As far as I know the form doesn't give any multipliers but it still gives boosts to durability and strength</td>

The move works by focusing alot of ki into a singular point and due to that it takes alot of focus and time to pull of but its really strong managing to kill raditz along with a weakened goku which was I'm pretty suredouble his power level</td>

    	<td>I may have some bias because this is my favorite move but still my point stands this move needs to be used more by some of the side characters the humans would benefit from it greatly due to the, not having any forms and piccolo could use it due to his regen powers . the move works by multiplying the users base stats by 2 using nirmal kaioken and can multiply it by 4 using kaioken 2x etc at the cost of straining the user's body which results in increasing blood pressure and swelling muscle mass .   </td>
